# Age-and-gender-detction-with-crowd-counting

**This is project is contributed by: R N SNEHA PRIYA**

This project detects the age and gender of each and every person once at a time but can count the total number of persons who are present at a place. The output is both displayed and also read aloud. 

This project is mainly developed using the concepts of Convolution Neural Network and OpenCV.

The contents in the Prototxt file (link mentioned below) are:

1. opencv_face_detector.pbtxt
2. opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb
3. age_deploy.prototxt
4. age_net.caffemodel
5. gender_deploy.prototxt
6. gender_net.caffemodel

Both the caffe models (age_net and gender_net) simply define the internal states of the parameters/gradients of those layers.

## How to run the project:

1. Check if all the paths mentioned in the code are modified according to the new path
2. Check if all the modules are properly imported.
3. Now just run the "**gad.py**" file.

## Minimum Hardware specifications needed for smooth function:
	- Intel core I5
	- Intel GPU
	- 8 GB RAM
